    "As discussed in Duchateau and Baudry (2014), maximal discharge rate during slow isometric ramp contractions usually reaches values of 20–50 Hz whereas it can attain much higher values (>100 Hz), albeit briefly, during fast contractions (for reviews, see Enoka and Fuglevand, 2001; Duchateau and Enoka, 2011). Therefore, pps values used above are not realistic, but are used to evaluate MNs behavior."
